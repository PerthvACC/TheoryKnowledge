!!! abstract "Non-Standard Positions"
      :material-information-outline: Non-standard positions may only be opened during events. 

## Airspace 

PH ADC is not responsible for any airspace by default.

## Taxiway Restrictions

- Link 1, 2, 3 & 4 are limited to Class C aircraft and above
- For A380/B747 available routes refer to PH Ground Movement Chart - Page 1

## Workload Management

### Pushback Requests on ACD

During busy periods such as during events, SMC and ACD may coordinate to implement the Pushback Requests on ACD procedure to balance the workload across ACD and SMC frequencies. 

When implementing the procedure, there should be some sort of indication to inform pilots the correct frequency on which to request pushback. 

## Local Procedures

### Scenic Flights

When traffic permits, VFR scenic flights should be cleared via the NORTHCOAST SCENIC (FACT-REEL-DOWN) or SOUTHCOAST SCENIC (FACT-STAD-GUAR-PENL) routes. Coordination with PH TCU is required prior to issuing this clearance, see ACD to PH TCU

## Helicopter Operations

There are no helipad facilities at IPPH. Helicopters should be issued an airways clearance in accordance with the fixed-wing operation applicable to their flight rules (i.e. SID for IFR helicopters, Visual Departure via appropriate VFR route if necessary for VFR helicopters). Helicopters should be cleared to takeoff/land from runways or taxiways, as deemed appropriate by ADC. The point of takeoff/landing must be specified by ADC. 

!!! phraseology
      **PH ADC:** "MRT, taxiway charlie, cleared for takeoff" <br>
      **PH ADC:** "HWO, runway 33, cleared to land"

## Runway Modes

### Preferred Runway Modes

Subject to wind limitations, single runway operations may be necessary. However, pending wind limitations (Crosswind <20kts, Tailwind <5kts), the following runway modes are to be used:

| Mode | Arrivals | Departures |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Northwest Plan (29AD/33A) | 29 & 33 | 29 |
| Southeast Plan (11AD/15D) | 11 | 11 & 15 |

### Circuit Training

Circuit training traffic shall be issued SSR code and clearance to operate within the circuit area not above `A015`. Circuit training is typically conducted on Runway 11/29.

Circuit direction should be influenced by the current runway mode currently active. Should single runway operations be in use, circuit direction should conform to the standard (left-hand circuits).

| Mode | Circuit Direction | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Northwest Plan | Right-hand circuits |
| Southeast Plan | Left-hand circuits |

## SID Selection

Aircraft planned via **HONDA** and **CAMEL** shall be assigned the appropriate **Procedural SID** that terminates at the appropriate waypoint. Aircraft not planned via any of these waypoints or aircraft with no filed route shall be assigned the **Radar SID**. 

### Off Mode Departures

!!! info "Definition"
      **Off Mode**: Aircraft departing from a runway not prescribed as active for departures on the ATIS. For example, a heavy aircraft that operationally requires Runway 11/29 during 15/33 single runway operations due to wind limitations. 

For aircraft departing Runway 11/29 **Off Mode**, the **Radar SID** must be assigned.

!!! note 
      Assigning the Radar SID to an off-mode departure does not meet the requirements for auto release. These aircraft must be 'Next' coordinated with PH TCU. 

## Coordination

### Auto Release

Next coordination is **not** required for aircraft that are:

- Departing from a runway nominated on the ATIS; and
- Assigned the standard assignable level; and 
- Assigned a **Procedural SID**

All other aircraft require a 'Next' call to PH TCU.

The Standard Assignable level from PH ADC to PH TCU is:

| Aircraft | Level |
| -------- | ----- |
| All | The lower of `A020` and `RFL` |

### Departures Controller

When a TCU controller is online, aircraft shall be issued with a departure frequency during their airways clearance in accordance with the table below. If no TCU controllers are online, the most appropriate Enroute controller or Advisory frequency shall be issued. 

| Runway | Via | Departure Frequency |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------- |
| All | All | 118.7 (PHD) |

## ACD to TCU

The controller assuming responsibility of ACD shall give heads-up coordination to the relevant PH TCU controller prior to the issue of the following clearances:

- VFR departures into PH TCU CTA
- Aircraft using a runway not on the ATIS
