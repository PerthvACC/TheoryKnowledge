# ADC - Aerodrome Control

## Responsibilities

The primary responsibilities of ADC are to:

- Apply runway seperation standards to prevent collisions on the runway
- Apply wake turbulence seperation standards to ensure departing aircraft are not affected by the wake turbulence vortices generated by preceding traffic
- At many aerodromes, ADC must also manage traffic to prevent collisions in the circuit area

Contrary to popular opinion, ADC control is more than simply issuing takeoff and landing clearances. These are the two most common phrases heard on air, but what you don't hear is the background work required in order to issue those clearances. 

### Runway Seperation

Runway seperation standards require a combination of minimum distances between aircraft and/or certain conditions to be met in order for a takeoff or landing clearance to be issued. Runway seperation standards must be applied between an aircraft:

- landing behind a preceding landing aircraft
- landing behind a departing aircraft
- departing behind a landing aircraft
- departing behind a preceding departing aircraft

Runway seperation standards in their most simple form require the following:

- the runway to be clear of other aircraft
- minimum distances between departures

### Wake Turbulence Seperation

Depending on the weight category of the aircraft, minimum distances or time intervals are required between successive departures. These are calculated to minimise the adverse effect of the wake turbulence vortices created by other traffic. 

### Manage Circuit Traffic

At many aerodromes, circuit traffic is managed by ADC rather than TCU. Generally speaking, this involves using a variety of tools & techniques to establish an orderly landing sequence.
