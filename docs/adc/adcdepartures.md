# Departures

## Overview

Before clearing a departure for takeoff, ADC must:

- ensure the aircraft is READY
- obtain departure instructions from TCU/ENR if applicable
- check that the runway is clear of other aircraft
- apply a runway seperation standard with the preceding departure
- apply wake turbulence seperation with the preceding departure

## READY call

The READY call serves two purposes: it is used by pilots to establish communications with ADC and notify their preparedness for departure. In other words, there is nothing that will delay the aircraft from commencing its takeoff roll once on the runway. ATC rely on the READY call to estimate timings and work out whether they can get the departure away ahead of the next arrival. 

Departing aircraft will contact ADC when READY at or approaching the holding point. If the aircraft does not report ready on initial contact, you should remind them to report when ready. 

!!! phraseology
      **QFA724:** "Perth Tower, QFA724, holding point A5" <br>
      **PH ADC:** "QFA724, Perth Tower, report ready" <br>
      **QFA724:** "Wilco, QFA724"

On recieving the READY call from an aircraft, the ADC controller has two choices of instructions:

- **LINE UP (AND WAIT)**
- **CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF**

You may simply acknowledge the aircraft's callsign if you want them to hold short of the runway. 

## Departure Instructions

You may recall that there are several types of departure procedures available. Some of these departure procedures require a departure instruction with the takeoff clearance. Coordination will need to be conducted to obtain the desired departure instructions from the TMA controller. Departure instructions should be recorded in the remarks field within the aircraft's strip in the departure list. 

### Auto Release

Auto Release is a procedure that allows the ADC controller to clear an aircraft to depart **without** coordination to the TCU/ENR controller. Since this is a TCU/ENR controller essentially letting aircraft enter their airspace, a number of conditions must be met to enable Auto Release to be used. 

### Coordination

ADC obtains the departure instructions from TCU/ENR through use of the NEXT call. The NEXT call from ADC lets TCU/ENR know that the aircraft is anticipated to be airborne *within two minutes*. On recieving the NEXT call, TCU/ENR provides departure instructions to ADC, who issues them to the aircraft. The instructions will vary depending on the local procedures, but can be summarised as:

- a radar heading or direction of turn for a visual departure,
- an altitude restriction, or
- The phrase "*UNRESTRICTED*" if there is no restriction to the initial altitude issued in the airways clearance. It does **not** mean ADC can climb a departure to their planned/requested level. 

ADC will then issue the departure instructions to the aircraft. 

!!! phraseology
      **PH ADC:** **ASSIGNED HEADING LEFT/RIGHT (three digits)** <br>
      **OR** <br>
      **PH ADC:** **TRACK EXTENDED RUNWAY CENTRELINE (three digits) DEGREES** <br>
      **OR** <br>
      **PH ADC:** **TURN LEFT/RIGHT HEADING (three digits) VISUAL** <br>
      **OR** <br>
      **PH ADC:** **MAKE LEFT/RIGHT TURN**

!!! phraseology
      **PH ADC:** "NEXT, QFA125" <br>
      **PH TCU:** "QFA125, left heading 320, UNRESTRICTED" <br>
      <br>
      **PH ADC:** "QFA125, assigned heading left 320, cleared for takeoff"

## Line Up [And Wait] Instruction

The instruction to LINE UP authorises an aircraft to enter the runway and align with the runway centreline. Aircraft must not commence take off unless issued with CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF. A LINE UP instruction is used when a take off clearance cannot be immediately issued but it is anticipated that there will be no delay on the runway. 

The further instruction AND WAIT indicates to the pilot that there will be a delay in the lined up position. It is used to emphasise that a take off clearance will not be issued straight away. The use of conditional clearances for line up and wait instructions is no longer used within Australia and thus should not be used. Simply wait until the arriving aircraft has passed the runway holding point of the departing aircraft then issue the instruction. 

## Runway Seperation

### Take off behind a previous departure

Do not clear an aircraft for take off until the preceding departure is airborne and has:

- passed the upwind threshold of the runway; or
- commenced a turn

### Take off behind previous arrival

Do not clear an aircraft for take off until the preceding arrival has vacated the runway fully. 

### Intersecting runway operations

Do not clear an aircraft to take off or land until a departing aircraft on the crossing runway has crossed the intersection, or an arriving aircraft has either crossed the intersection or landed and stopped short of the intersection. 

## Issue Take Off Clearance

!!! phraseology 
      **PH ADC:** "QFA12, cleared for takeoff" <br>
      <br>
      **PH ADC:** "QFA12, runway 29 cleared for takeoff" <br>
      <br>
      **PH ADC:** "QFA12, assigned heading left 220, runway 29 cleared for takeoff" 


### Traffic Information

Traffic information can be issued with a takeoff clearance where the controller deems it necessary, e.g. aircraft joining the circuit with another aircraft already in the circuit. 

!!! phraseology
      **PH ADC:** "GBT, traffic is a Cessna 172 on crosswind remaining in the circuit, runway 29 cleared for takeoff"

## Frequency Transfer

In most cases, a pilot will need to change to the Departures frequency shortly after takeoff. This can be included in the takeoff clearance or in a seperate instruction once the aircraft has been observed to be airborne. When no departure service is available the aircraft should be approved to change frequency to the advisory frequency. 

!!! phraseology
      **PH ADC:** "QFA621 contact departures" <br>
      <br>
      **PH ADC:** "QFA71, frequency change approved"
