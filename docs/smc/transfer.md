# Frequency Transfer to ADC

## When to explicitly transfer an aircraft?

Once an aircraft is at the runway holding point, the SMC controller is no longer relevant for the aircraft - only ADC can clear the aircraft to either enter an active runway, or takeoff. In Australia, most domestic aircraft will independently contact the tower once at or approaching the holding point. For international aircraft, who may not be as familiar with local procedures, an explicit transfer is required. In the absence of ADC being online, aircraft at the holding point shall be instructed to monitor advisory on 122.8

!!! note 
      Pilots on the ATC24 network and even on VATSIM are not aware of their duty to contact the tower controller autonomously and so it is best practice to provide an explicit frequency transfer to all departing aircraft. The main thing is to be consistent. You don't want an aircraft sitting idle at the holding point awaiting a frequency transfer from you. 

!!! phraseology
      **PH SMC:** "UAL2915, contact tower 124.7" <br>
      **UAL2915:** "Tower 124.7, UAL2915" <br>
      **OR** <br>
      **PH SMC:** "QFA844, at the holding point, contact tower 124.7" <br>
      **QFA844:** "Wilco, QFA844" 

Ensure that you no longer need to have contact with the aircraft before this transfer, and that you have seperation assurance guaranteed all the way to the holding point.
