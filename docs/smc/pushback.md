# Pushback

## Purpose

During pushback, an aircraft moves from a parking position onto the manoeuvring area. This represents a movement into what is considered an 'active' area and is why aircraft request authorisation from the relevant SMC controller before carrying out the procedure. When a pushback request is recieved, the ground controller should consider other active traffic and provide any relevant traffic information along with the approval.

!!! info "Traffic Information"
      Note that directed traffic information should always be passed to both parties involved. If traffic information is given to the aircraft pushing back, it should also be provided to the other traffic. There is no requirement to provide seperation instructions to either aircraft as collision avoidance are the pilots and ground crew's responsibility. 

## Start Clearance

Start clearance is required for aircraft to begin engine start procedures should local SOPs dictate. This is usually requested along with pushback since most commercial airliners start their engines during pushback.
