# ATIS

## What is an ATIS?

An Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) is a recorded audio loop of operational and weather information for a controlled aerodrome. When approaching or departing a controlled aerodrome, pilots tune to a designated radio frequency to listen to the recording. It provides information about:

- The type of approach to expect 
- The runway(s) in use
- Current weather conditions
- Any other relevant operational information

Note that due to limitations with discord/Roblox, ATC24 provides an ATIS in text form for pilots to read. 

## Updating an ATIS

The METAR within PTFS gets updated pretty often and so it is up to you when to update the ATIS, however in the real world, ATIS changes are subject to changes in meterological and operational conditions described below. Every time you update an ATIS, a new code letter should be issued. 

- The requirement for, or type of, instrument approach is changed
- Changes occur to a traffic management initiative e.g. LAHSO
- The take-off or landing runway is changed
- Changes occur in the operational status of an aerodrome
- Current values of meterological information vary by, or exceed, the values in the table below:

| MET Information  | Variation |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Wind | Direction 10° or Speed 5 kt |
| QNH | 1 Hectopascal (HPA) |
| Temperature | 1° |

## Broadcasting ATIS changes on frequency

Whenever a new ATIS is released, the **changes** must be broadcast on SMC and ACD frequencies.
