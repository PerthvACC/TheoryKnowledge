# Taxi 

## Structure and Phraseology

When issuing taxi instructions, correct structure and phraseology ensure that the correct route is followed by the pilot and runway incursions are prevented. You must provide concise taxi instructions that:

- Give adequate information to assist pilots in determining correct taxi routes and avoid collisions with other aircraft or obstructions, and;
- Regulate entry to and movement on taxiways

Regardless of the type of taxi instruction you issue, you must always issue a taxi limit. The taxi limit can be a runway holding point, or an intersection where two taxiways meet. Depending on the traffic situation, you may elect to issue a simple taxi clearance or outline the taxi clearance precisely to avoid aircraft turning onto the wrong taxiways and ending up nose-to-nose with another aircraft. 

!!! phraseology
      **QFA625:** "QFA625 recieved Bravo, request taxi" <br>
      **PH SMC:** "QFA625 taxi to holding point Echo, Runway 33" <br>
      **QFA625:** "Taxi to holding point Echo, Runway 33, QFA625" 

!!! phraseology
      **UAE21:** "UAE21 Heavy, recieved Mike, request taxi" <br>
      **PH SMC:** "UAE21 Heavy, taxi Delta, Echo, holding point Echo, Runway 33" <br>
      **UAE21:** "Taxi Delta, Echo, holding point Echo Runway 33, UAE21" <br>

### Phraseology don'ts

- Don't use the word 'cleared' when issuing taxi instructions and runway crossings, A taxi instruction is just that - an instruction, not a clearance. 
- Don't refer to both designations of a runway (e.g. "cross Runway 11/29"). Only refer to the 'active-end' of a runway in an instruction. If the runway is not in use, just choose the most into the wind designation and be consistent. 

## Hold Short / Cross Runway Instructions

A taxi instruction that contains a taxi limit beyond a runway **must** include a **"CROSS RUNWAY (number)"** instruction. But before we can issue this, SMC must first get permission from the ADC to allow the aircraft to use/cross the runway, even if the runway is not active. Coordination phraseology will be discussed further in. If permission to cross the runway is not available when the aircraft calls for taxi, the aircraft must be issued a taxi limit of the holding point associated with the intersecting runway along the taxi route. Taxi instructions must not include a position beyond that of a required intermediate holding point. 

Taxiing aircraft must be issued with an instruction to "CROSS RUNWAY (number)" if previously issued with;

1. A taxi instruction limit of the holding point of a runway intersecting the taxi route; or
2. An instruction to "HOLD SHORT" of a runway.

!!! phraseology
      **PH SMC:** "SIA2374, taxi Delta Two, cross Runway 33, Alpha, holding point Alpha Five, Runway 29" <br>
      **SIA2374:** "Taxi Delta Two, cross Runway 33, Alpha, holding point Alpha Five, Runway 29, SIA2374" 

!!! phraseology
      **PH SMC:** "QFA520, taxi Delta Two, hold short Runway 33" <br>
      **QFA520:** "Taxi Delta Two, hold short Runway 33, QFA520"

## Controlling the Flow of Ground Traffic

### Intermediate Hold Short / Give Way / Follow

Issuing intermediate hold short instructions allows you to establish positive seperation on the ground, by instructing an aircraft to hold short of a specific taxiway, where aircraft may need to cross paths. This then becomes a taxi limit, the aircraft cannot taxi further without recieving a new taxi instruction from the controller, and ground seperation is maintained. Instructing aircraft to **"GIVE WAY"** or **"FOLLOW"** will reduce controller workload, and keep the flow of traffic moving, while allowing pilots to establish their own seperation on the ground. 

!!! phraseology
      **PH SMC:** "QLK2151, give way to the Emirates 777 on Tango Lane, hold short Runway 33" <br>
      <br>
      **PH SMC:** "DLH25EY, follow the Qantas 380 on Tango Lane"
