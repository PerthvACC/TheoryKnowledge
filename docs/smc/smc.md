# Surface Movement Control - Overview

## Responsibilities

The primary responsibility of the SMC controller is to prevent collisions between aircraft on the ground. This is done through issuing taxi instructions to regulate and control the movement of aircraft within the manoeuvring area. The secondary responsibility of the SMC controller is to maintain an orderly and efficient flow of traffic on the ground through careful planning of taxi routes and analysing traffic priorities to minimise delays. Typical duties for SMC include:

- issuing taxi clearances 
- issuing pushback approvals and providing traffic information
- coordinating runway crossings for taxiing aircraft

## Collision Avoidance

ATC responsibility for collision avoidance only covers parts of the aerodrome used for take-off, landing and taxiing of aircraft, excluding aprons and parking areas. This is known as the manoeuvring area. ATC is not responsible for aircraft operations on aprons, parking areas or any other area outside the manoeuvring area. Therefore, an ATC clearance is not required to operate on these areas. 

On the manoeuvring area, collision avoidance is a joint pilot-controller responsibility whereas beyond the manoeuvring area it is the responsibility of the pilot and any assisting ground personnel. ATC will help by providing traffic information about other aircraft entering or leaving the same apron or parking area. 

## Pushback

Aircraft will usually start their engines during or shortly after pushback. Clearance to start engines is not normally required from ATC unless outlined in local procedures. Aircraft must request pushback approval from SMC. SMC will issue the approval whilst taking into account other moving traffic and provide traffic information where necessary. The pilot and assisting ground crew are then responsible for collision avoidance during the pushback sequence. 

Pushback approval may be withheld to regulate the entry of aircraft onto the taxiways during busy periods. This is important at some locations where aircraft pushback directly onto taxiways. Withholding approval can also assist in maintaining an efficient flow of traffic across the aerodrome. 

## Regulating Traffic Flow

While the primary responsibility is to prevent collisions, the secondary responsibility is the orderly flow of traffic around the aerodrome. This is the responsibility of SMC, who must come up with a plan to get the arrivals to the gate and departures to the holding point with minimal delay.

It requires a 'big picture' approach, such as familiarity with the available taxi routes, holding points and required runway crossings. Prioritising arrivals over departures is important and will assist your decision making. Traffic can be regulated through the use of progressive taxi instructions, holding departures on the apron, and instructing aircraft to give way or follow other aircraft.
