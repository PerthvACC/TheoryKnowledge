# Runway Crossings and Releases

## Procedure

Previously we learnt that a ground controller's area of responsibility does not include runways, even if the runway is inactive, and that we must first coordinate with Tower before instructing an aircraft to taxi across, enter or back track a runway. This coordination should occur in a timely fashion, just prior to the aircraft reaching the runway. 

When coordinating with Tower, there are three key items that must be used. 

- **Aircraft Type:** A320, B737, B777, A380, etc
- **Location:** Taxiway the aircraft is currently on
- **Runway:** The runway the aircraft will enter, back track or cross

!!! phraseology 
      **PH SMC:** "B737 at Delta Two to cross Runway 33" <br>
      **PH ADC:** "B737 at Delta Two cross Runway 33" <br>
      **OR** <br>
      **PH ADC:** "Negative, Hold Short"

Tower should respond with one of the above, providing a hold short instruction if the request is unable to be approved. Ground should ensure they read back the instruction to Tower, using the following phraseology:

!!! phraseology
      **PH SMC:** "Cross Runway 33 at Delta Two"

## Runway Release

A runway release is the process of releasing a non active runway from Tower to Ground, this reduces the workload of both controllers by allowing Ground to instruct aircraft to cross or otherwise use the non-active runway without having to coordinate with Tower. 

!!! phraseology
      **PH SMC:** "Request Runway 33 release to Ground" <br>
      **PH ADC:** "Runway 33 released to Ground" 
      
Note that Tower can recall a runway release immediately. Upon recall, Ground shall acknowledge the recall with a traffic statement:

!!! phraseology
      **PH SMC:** "Runway 33, No traffic" <br>
      **OR** <br>
      **PH SMC:** "Runway 33, Traffic is a Qantas 747 crossing at Delta Two"

## ADC Offline

When controlling SMC with ADC offline, the runways have not been released to SMC, they are *uncontrolled*. This means traffic is permitted to use the runway for landing/takeoff without permission of the SMC controller. Any aircraft that requires to cross a runway shall be given a traffic statement as follows:

!!! phraseology
      **PH SMC:** "QFA261, Cross Runway 33 at your discretion, no reported or observed traffic" <br>
      **OR** <br>
      **PH SMC:** "QFA261, Cross Runway 33 at your discretion, traffic observed on a 5nm final, callsign is UAL9125"
